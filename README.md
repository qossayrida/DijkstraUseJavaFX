# GIS Route Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project implements an optimized version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for geographic information systems (GIS), such as those used in MapQuest and GPS-based navigation systems. The program computes the shortest route between cities on a map based on Euclidean distances and displays the route on a visual map interface.

## Features

1. **Interactive Map Interface**: Select cities using mouse and keyboard inputs.
2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Finds and displays the lowest-cost route between two selected cities.
3. **Dynamic Route Display**: The route is shown visually on the map.
4. **Optimized for Large Maps**: Efficiently handles maps with at least 50 cities and thousands of edges.
5. **Map Preprocessing**: Speeds up repeated shortest path queries by reusing previous computations.

## File Format

The map is represented in a text file with the following structure:

    Number of vertices (cities)  
    Number of edges (roads) 
    City1 Latitude1 Longitude1  0   (0 means this road cross)  
    City2 Latitude2 Longitude2  1   (1 means this city) 
    ...  
    Edge1_City1 Edge1_City2  
    Edge2_City1 Edge2_City2  
    ...  

Example:

    6
    9
    City1 31.52583 34.45250    1
    City2 31.53389 35.09944    1
    City3 31.52972 34.48139    1
    City4 31.35611 34.30139    1
    City5 31.90000 35.20417    1
    cross1 31.70639 35.20167   0 
    City1 City2
    City1 City4
    City2 City3
    City2 City5
    City3 City5
    City3 City4
    City3 cross1
    City4 cross1
    City5 cross1
